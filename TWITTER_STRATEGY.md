### Friday - Industry/Kaspa Commentary
**Best Time**: 10 AM EST
**Format**: Hot take or news reaction
**Goal**: Thought leadership, Kaspa ecosystem

**Example Tweets:**
```
Hot take:

"Play-to-earn" failed because games were work.

"Quiz-to-earn" will succeed because knowledge is already yours.

You're not grinding. You're proving what you know.

That's the difference. 🧠⚡
```

```
While other blockchains promise "fast settlements,"

@kaspa_currency delivers sub-6 second finality.

Not a promise. A reality.

That's why Geek Protocol is built on Kaspa.

Speed isn't a feature. It's the foundation. ⚡
```

```
The knowledge economy is broken:

💔 LinkedIn: Your resume, their platform
💔 Medium: Your content, their paywall
💔 Quora: Your answers, their ads

Geek Protocol: Your knowledge, your wallet.

Web3 fixes this. 🧠🔓
```
