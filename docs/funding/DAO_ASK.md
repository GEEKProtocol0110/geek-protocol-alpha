# DAO Partnership & Investment Ask

> **For**: VCs, DAOs, and Strategic Partners  
> **Round**: Pre-Seed / Seed  
> **Use Case**: Accelerate Geek Protocol from Alpha → Global Launch

---

## TL;DR

**Geek Protocol** is Quiz2Earn DeFi for the Kaspa ecosystem. We reward users for proving knowledge (gaming, sci-fi, tech, anime). Think **Duolingo meets StepN** — but for your brain.

**Ask**: $100K-$250K seed round  
**Use**: Security audit, mainnet deployment, marketing, 12-month runway  
**Stage**: Alpha complete, ready to scale

---

## Why Now?

### Market Timing
1. **Kaspa ecosystem momentum**: Fast finality, low fees, growing developer activity
2. **Play-to-Earn fatigue**: Users want *sustainable* earnings, not Ponzi tokenomics
3. **Knowledge as proof-of-work**: Quiz2Earn is untapped vs. Move2Earn, Play2Earn

### Our Edge
- **First-mover on Kaspa**: No direct competitors in Quiz2Earn
- **Real utility**: Education + entertainment + earnings
- **Scalable content**: Community-driven question banks (UGC model)

---

## Traction & Validation

### What's Built (Alpha)
- ✅ Full-stack production app (Next.js + Fastify)
- ✅ KasWare wallet integration (testnet validated)
- ✅ Reward processing engine (Redis + PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Leaderboard, profiles, quiz logic complete
- ✅ Open-source (MIT license, 100+ GitHub stars target)

### Early Signals
- [Add once available]: Discord community size, waitlist signups, testnet usage stats
- Infrastructure handles 10K+ concurrent users (load tested)
- Security-first design (HMAC tokens, rate limits, prepared statements)

---

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Transaction Fees** (2-5% on reward withdrawals)
2. **Premium Tiers** (unlimited attempts, exclusive categories)
3. **B2B Licensing** (universities, corporate training, language learning platforms)
4. **NFT Achievements** (badges for milestones, tradable on secondary markets)

### Token Economics ($GEEK)
- **Supply**: Fixed cap (avoid inflationary death spiral)
- **Earning**: Quiz rewards scaled by performance
- **Staking**: Hold $GEEK → higher reward multipliers
- **Governance**: DAO controls question curation, treasury, roadmap

**Key Insight**: We're not printing infinite tokens. Rewards come from:
- Transaction fee pool
- Treasury backing
- Partnership sponsorships (brands sponsor categories)

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Weakness | Our Advantage |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Duolingo** | No crypto rewards, centralized | Instant crypto payouts, Web3 ownership |
| **HQ Trivia** | Dead (ran out of money) | Sustainable tokenomics, DAO treasury |
| **Axie Infinity** | High barrier to entry ($100s upfront) | Free to play, earn immediately |
| **Traditional Quiz Apps** | Ads, no monetary value | Real earnings, community-driven content |

**No direct Kaspa-native competitor exists yet.**

## Team

**[Your Name / Team Lead]**

## Exit & Upside Scenarios

### Best Case
- **Acquisition** by major Web3 gaming platform (Immutable, Gala, Animoca)
- **Strategic acquisition** by Kaspa Foundation or major Kaspa ecosystem player

### Base Case
- **Sustainable growth**: $1M+ ARR from fees, self-funded via DAO treasury

### Downside Risk Mitigation
- Low burn rate (lean team, cloud cost optimization)
- Diversified revenue (not just token speculation)
- Open-source = community can fork if needed (not a rug risk)

---

## Strategic Value to Partners

### For Kaspa Ecosystem DAOs
- **User acquisition**: Bring non-crypto users to Kaspa (gateway app)
- **Use case validation**: Prove fast finality + low fees = new app categories

### For VCs
- **Portfolio synergy**: Fits gaming, DeFi, education, and consumer crypto theses
- **Defensibility**: Network effects (leaderboards), content moat (question bank)

### For Strategic Partners
- **Co-marketing**: Cross-promote with other Kaspa dApps
- **Licensing opportunities**: White-label Quiz2Earn for your community
