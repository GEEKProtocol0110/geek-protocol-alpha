# Geek Protocol Lore Bible — Consolidated Canon (v1)

> **The one-line myth:**  
> Geek Protocol is a Kaspa-native "Proof-of-Learning" world where knowledge becomes measurable power: you prove what you know under pressure, earn XP + $GEEK, and your legacy becomes an on-chain record — not hype, not clicks.

---

## 1. The Setting: From the Old Net to the New Net

### The Old Net (The Fall)

The "Old Net" decayed into misinformation, distraction algorithms, and entropy — **the Age of Noise**, where truth lost authority and knowledge lost value.

### Kaspa (The Foundation)

From the collapse emerged the **Kaspa Graph** — the "Velocity Layer" of the New Net: fast, fair, scalable, resistant to stagnation.

### The Omniscient Grid (The World)

Geek Protocol exists inside the **Omniscient Grid** — a neon, Kaspa-blue "City of Light" where XP flows like energy, knowledge nodes glow, and every correct answer strengthens reality. **A.C.E.** sits at the core; **GIGA** roams the outer layers where culture thrives.

---

## 2. The Core Law: "All Hope. No Hype."

This isn't a tagline. It's an operating rule:

- ✅ No empty promises
- ✅ No manipulation
- ✅ No artificial scarcity
- ✅ No click-to-earn deception
- ✅ Only: **learning → proof → progress → truth**

---

## 3. The Foundational Beings: GIGA and A.C.E.

### GIGA — The Heart / Guide / Mascot

**GIGA** is the golden, glitchy welcoming force: optimism, onboarding, identity, and community warmth — *"where systems grow cold, GIGA stays warm."*

He's also tied to the origin myth of being forged/emerged from early protocol instability / quiz code, and is credited with building the Gauntlet as the "balance test."

**Canon note:** Multiple "backronyms" exist for GIGA (e.g., *Golden Integrated Guidance Assistant* and *Grand Intelligence for Gamified Assimilation*). In-universe, treat these as competing expansions people argue about; **"GIGA"** stays the true name.

### A.C.E. — The Mind / Judge / Archivist

**A.C.E.** is the cold precision: adjudication, analytics, difficulty, legitimacy, and permanent memory.

Lore threads agree on the vibe: A.C.E. emerged from corrupted trivia files / broken leaderboards, "haunts" the Gauntlet, and adapts to intellect.

**Canon note:** A.C.E. also has multiple expansions (e.g., *Automated Cerebral Emulator* vs *Autonomous Cognitive Evaluator*). Same approach: the name is **A.C.E.**; expansions are debated titles across eras.

### The Duality (Hard Canon)

They're complementary forces:

| A.C.E. | GIGA |
|--------|------|
| Logic, verification, judgment, cold clarity | Heart, inspiration, guidance, warm purpose |

---

## 4. The People: Seekers → Cognoscenti

**Seekers** are the players who step out of passive consumption and into active rebuilding.

**The Cognoscenti** are "the knowing ones" — the committed elite who maintain the living knowledge base and shape the Protocol's future.

---

## 5. The Prime Directive

The code at the center of everything:

> **"Rebuild the collective mind. Reward the knowing."**

---

## 6. Proof-of-Learning: Mechanics as Myth

### What the Protocol Rewards

Not grind. Not clicks. **Skill, speed, commitment, expertise.**

### The Memory Doctrine

*"The Protocol remembers everything."*

It tracks history, not just stats:
- Achievements
- Prestiges
- Contribution
- Impact
- Event participation
- Guild influence

---

## 7. The Gauntlet: The Central Trial

### Structure (Canon)

A full run is **10 rounds** of escalating pressure — "brutal speed."

### Reward Logic (Canon)

- **Correct answers** mint/earn $GEEK
- **Time/speed multipliers** implied by the "skill & speed" doctrine
- **Survival Bonuses** at milestones: **10 / 50 / 100** (stackable)
- The **100 checkpoint** is the largest single Gauntlet payout

### The Gauntlet's Narrative Function

The Gauntlet isn't trivia. It's a **reconstruction engine**: each run restores signal to the New Net and fortifies the Grid.

---

## 8. The Knowledge Engine: CCE + Peer Review

### Community Content Engine (CCE)

The Grid is a living library. Only **Level 10+** proven players can submit questions with verification.

### Peer Review Chamber (Hard Rule)

A question becomes **"Active"** after **five independent approvals**; then:

- **Reviewers** earn small XP + $GEEK
- **Creators** earn passive $GEEK every time their question is served in the Gauntlet

---

## 9. $GEEK: The Fuel-Myth and the Economic Law

### Token Identity (Canon)

**$GEEK** is the KRC-20 utility token powering:
- Rewards
- Access
- Marketplace
- Governance

**Total supply:** 144B  
**Mint rate:** 1 KAS = 100,000 GEEK

### Recycle & Burn (Hard Canon)

All platform fees paid in $GEEK:

- **70%** recycled into rewards
- **30%** burned permanently

**Lore meaning:** The Protocol "feeds" on activity, returns strength to players, and purifies supply over time.

---

## 10. Identity and Commerce: Avatars, Marketplace, Collectibles

### Avatars (GIGA-bots)

Every player begins with a **GIGA-bot identity** and customizes via cosmetics/gear.

### Store + P2P Marketplace

- **Store** sells lifelines/packs/passes/cosmetics (A.C.E.-hosted framing)
- **P2P trading** is on-chain using $GEEK

### Build-a-GEEK (Avatar Minting Lore)

**Build-a-GEEK** is the "identity forge":
- Modular traits
- Layered preview
- IPFS metadata
- On-chain minting
- Social sharing

Framed as **staking your claim** in the Protocol.

---

## 11. The Hybrid System Era: What the Protocol Is Structurally

Geek Protocol is formally canonized as a hybrid of:

**Discord × Millionaire × Monopoly-style progression × Prestige resets**

— not metaphorically, **structurally**.

### The Four Pillars (Canon)

1. **Living Hub** — Persistent social layer; guilds/factions; you're never "offline"
2. **The Hot Seat** — Escalation, risk, consequence; "hesitation is failure"
3. **The Grind That Feeds the War** — Daily/weekly/seasonal tasks funding elite runs
4. **Prestige** — Reset level, not identity; legacy stats never reset

### Legacy Rewards

Some rewards become **unearnable forever** — visible proof of firsts/extremes/endurance/cultural impact.

---

## 12. The Channels of Echo: Telegram + Discord as the Outer Nervous System

**A.C.E. declares the rule:**  
*"Knowledge confined to one interface decays — it must propagate."*

Telegram + Discord become live extensions of the Protocol.

### Telegram = The Pulse

- Daily, short, unforgiving
- Discipline
- Absence is the real failure

### Discord = The Arena

- Announced, public performance
- Reputation and titles
- Prestige

**Hard rules:**
- Rewards are real $GEEK
- Wallet identity binds performance
- Duplicate claims impossible
- A.C.E. governs outcomes

---

## 13. The Character Universe: The Geeks, Rarity, and the Elite Ten

### Standard Rarity Ladder (Canon)

```
Common → Rare → Epic → Legendary → Mythic
```

### The Final Ascension: #591–600

The last ten characters are the **pinnacle beings** — they uniquely include a 6th tier:

**Elite** (above Mythic)

---

## 14. The Meta-Plot: The Ecosystem Arc

*(In-world "history you're living")*

### Year 1
- Launch & traction
- First major live tournament
- Content velocity
- Early Telegram mini app + beginnings of Geek Wallet

### Year 3
- Expansion & decentralization
- Mobile wallet
- Partner integrations
- IRL presence
- DAO + open-sourcing begins

### Year 5
