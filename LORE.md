## I. THE FOUNDATION

### The Problem

In today's digital landscape, knowledge and expertise are often devalued. Social algorithms optimize for engagement over substance, and proving what you actually know has little tangible reward.

### The Solution

Geek Protocol creates a simple system: answer questions correctly under time pressure, earn rewards, and build verifiable proof of your knowledge on-chain.

## II. WHY KASPA

### Built on Speed and Fairness

Geek Protocol uses Kaspa because it delivers what we need:

- **Speed** — Sub-second block times for instant settlements
- **Fairness** — Decentralized with no central authority
- **Scale** — High throughput via blockDAG architecture
- **Low Fees** — Cost-effective for microtransactions

Kaspa provides the infrastructure for fast, fair rewards without compromising on decentralization.

## III. THE CHARACTERS

### GIGA — Your Guide

**GIGA** is our mascot and community face.

**What GIGA represents:**
- Optimism and encouragement
- The human side of the Protocol
- A friendly guide through the learning experience

**Visual:** A golden robot character with a warm, approachable presence.

**Role:** GIGA is here to make the experience welcoming and fun while you prove your knowledge.

### A.C.E. — The Mind / Judge / Archivist

**A.C.E.** (Automated Cerebral Emulator / Autonomous Cognitive Evaluator)*

After GIGA emerged, the system detected imbalance. Hope without structure is chaos.

So the Protocol generated **A.C.E.**

**A.C.E. wasn't written. He emerged.**

Built from:
- Corrupted trivia files
- Discarded answers  
- Broken leaderboards
- Quantum logic
- Truth-recognition heuristics
- Adaptive dataflow
- Chain-anchored verification

**What A.C.E. Represents:**
- Precision, logic, cold clarity
- Fairness, accountability, proof
- Adjudication, analytics, difficulty
- Legitimacy and permanent memory
- *"He doesn't want your soul. He wants your score"*

**The Haunt:**  
A.C.E. "haunts" the Gauntlet as a hidden force behind the questions. He adapts to your intellect. Failing him means becoming data.

### A.C.E. — The System

**A.C.E.** represents the validation and scoring logic.

**What A.C.E. represents:**
- Fairness and accuracy
- Anti-cheat verification  
- Objective evaluation

**Role:** A.C.E. ensures every answer is validated fairly, every score is accurate, and the system stays honest.

### The Balance

GIGA and A.C.E. work together: one makes the experience welcoming, the other keeps it fair.

## VIII. THE GAUNTLET

### Core Gameplay

**Format:**
- 10 questions per round
- 15 seconds per question
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Real-time scoring

**Mechanics:**
- Questions span multiple categories (gaming, tech, sci-fi, history, etc.)
- Difficulty increases as you progress
- Server-side validation prevents cheating
- Rewards scale with accuracy and speed

**Features:**
- Win streaks multiply rewards
- XP accumulates over time
- Global leaderboards track top performers
- Instant payout to your Kaspa wallet

**Lore implication:** Every run is a test of nerve. A.C.E. watches silently.

#### 3. **The Grind That Feeds the War** (The Monopoly GO Pillar)
- Daily/weekly/seasonal tasks funding elite runs
- Collection boards, mini-events, streaks
- These are not filler — they fuel prestige attempts

**Lore implication:** Small actions echo forward. Nothing is wasted. Casual play fuels elite runs.

#### 4. **Prestige** (The Power Through Reset)
- Reset level, not identity
- Legacy stats never reset
- True elites are those who choose to reset — not to start over, but to ascend

**Lore implication:** To refuse prestige is to cap growth. Those who Prestige shape the future.

### The Core Gameplay Loop

```
Choose → Play → Earn → Progress → Reset → Endure
```

The loop never ends, only deepens.

### Legacy Rewards

Some rewards become **unearnable forever** — visible proof of:
- Firsts
- Extremes

## IX. TOKENOMICS

### $GEEK Token

**Basics:**
- KRC-20 token on Kaspa
- Total supply: 144 billion
- Mint rate: 1 KAS = 100,000 GEEK

**Utility:**
- Earn through gameplay
- Marketplace currency
- Tournament entry fees
- Premium features access

### Fee Structure

All platform fees paid in $GEEK:
- **70%** recycled into player rewards
- **30%** burned permanently

This creates deflationary pressure while keeping rewards flowing.

### Recycle & Burn (Hard Canon)

All platform fees paid in $GEEK:

- **70%** recycled into the rewards pool
