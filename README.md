## **1. About Geek Protocol**

Geek Protocol is a gamified Web3 ecosystem being built on the **Kaspa** network. Our mission is to create the definitive hub for geek culture where users can learn, compete in high-stakes trivia, and monetize their expertise. The platform features a Quiz-to-Earn engine, a player-owned economy with a peer-to-peer marketplace, deep gamification mechanics, and a unique user experience hosted by our AI character, A.C.E.

## **2. Project Status**

**Phase:** `Pre-Development`

**Current Milestone:** `1 of 12 - Secure Freelance Developer for Testnet MVP`

The project is currently in the foundational stage. The strategic blueprint is complete, and we are actively sourcing our initial development talent to build the Testnet MVP as outlined in our public roadmap.

## **3. Core Features**

* **🧠 Quiz-to-Earn "Geek Gauntlet":** A high-stakes, 100-question trivia game with time limits and increasing difficulty.
* **🏆 Deep Gamification:** A full progression system including XP, levels, achievements (as NFTs), and collectible sets.
* **🤖 Customizable Avatars:** Users get their own "Giga" mascot avatar to customize with NFT apparel and accessories.
* **⚖️ P2P Marketplace:** An on-chain marketplace for users to trade their cosmetic items and collectibles.
* **🤝 Community Content Engine:** A long-term vision for users to submit, review, and earn passive income from their own quiz questions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
